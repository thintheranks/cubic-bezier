Not C: not attached
C0 : Attached and corner
C1 : Mirror (2,3,4) P4 = 2P3 - P2    

G0 : = C0
G1 : (2,3,4) P4 = P3 + (P3 - P2)*B1 
G2 : (2,3,4,5) P5 = P3 + (P3 - P2)(2B1 + B1^2 + B2/2) + (P1 - P2)B1^2   .Lose local control!
B1 ( 1 = mirror ) : var
B2 : var

C implies occasional G



okay so need way to borrow then change handles but it needs
to keep track of wether it changed.
